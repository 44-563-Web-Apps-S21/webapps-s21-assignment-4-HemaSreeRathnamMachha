        <h6 class="name">PETRUCHIO</h6>
        <p class="speech PETRUCHIO">Come on, i' God's name; once more toward our father's.
        Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!</p>
        <h6 class="name">KATHARINA</h6>
        <p class="speech KATHARINA">The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now.</p>
        <h6 class="name">PETRUCHIO</h6>
        <p class="speech PETRUCHIO">I say it is the moon that shines so bright.</p>
        <h6 class="name">KATHARINA</h6>
        <p class="speech KATHARINA">I know it is the sun that shines so bright.</p>
        <h6 class="name">PETRUCHIO</h6>
        <p class="speech PETRUCHIO">Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself,
        It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
        Or ere I journey to your father's house.
        Go on, and fetch our horses back again.
        Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!</p>
        <h6 class="name">HORTENSIO</h6>
        <p class="speech HORTENSIO">Say as he says, or we shall never go.</p>
        <h6 class="name">KATHARINA</h6>
        <p class="speech KATHARINA">Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
        And be it moon, or sun, or what you please:
        An if you please to call it a rush-candle,
        Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.</p>
        <h6 class="name">PETRUCHIO</h6>
        <p class="speech PETRUCHIO">I say it is the moon.</p>
        <h6 class="name">KATHARINA</h6>
        <p class="speech KATHARINA">I know it is the moon.</p>
        <h6 class="name">PETRUCHIO</h6>
        <p class="speech PETRUCHIO">Nay, then you lie: it is the blessed sun.</p>
        <h6 class="name">KATHARINA</h6>
        <p class="speech KATHARINA">Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun:
        But sun it is not, when you say it is not;
        And the moon changes even as your mind.
        What you will have it named, even that it is;
        And so it shall be so for Katharina.</p>
        <h6 class="name">HORTENSIO</h6>
        <p class="speech HORTENSIO">Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won.</p>
        <h6 class="name">PETRUCHIO</h6>
        <p class="speech PETRUCHIO">Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,
        And not unluckily against the bias.
        But, soft! company is coming here.</p>
        <p class="stage-direction">Enter VINCENTIO</p>

        <p class="stage-direction">To VINCENTIO</p>

        <p class="speech VINCENTIO">Good morrow, gentle mistress: where away?
        Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
        Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?
        Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
        What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,
        As those two eyes become that heavenly face?
        Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.
        Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.</p>
        <h6 class="name">HORTENSIO</h6>
        <p class="speech HORTENSIO">A' will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.</p>
        <h6 class="name">KATHARINA</h6>
        <p class="speech KATHARINA">Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,
        Whither away, or where is thy abode?
        Happy the parents of so fair a child;
        Happier the man, whom favourable stars
        Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow!</p>
        <h6 class="name">PETRUCHIO</h6>
        <p class="speech PETRUCHIO">Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad:
        This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,
        And not a maiden, as thou say'st he is.</p>
        <h6 class="name">KATHARINA</h6>
        <p class="speech KATHARINA">Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,
        That have been so bedazzled with the sun
        That everything I look on seemeth green:
        Now I perceive thou art a reverend father;
        Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.</p>
        <h6 class="name">PETRUCHIO</h6>
        <p class="speech PETRUCHIO">Do, good old grandsire; and withal make known
        Which way thou travellest: if along with us,
        We shall be joyful of thy company.</p>
        <h6 class="name">VINCENTIO</h6>
        <p class="speech VINCENTIO">Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
        That with your strange encounter much amazed me,
        My name is call'd Vincentio; my dwelling Pisa;
        And bound I am to Padua; there to visit
        A son of mine, which long I have not seen.</p>
        <h6 class="name">PETRUCHIO</h6>
        <p class="speech PETRUCHIO">What is his name?</p>
