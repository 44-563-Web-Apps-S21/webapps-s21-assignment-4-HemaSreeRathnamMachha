        <h4>SCENE V. A public road.</h4>
        Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, HORTENSIO, and Servants
        <h4>PETRUCHIO</h4>
        Come on, i' God's name; once more toward our father's.<br>
        Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!
        <h4>KATHARINA</h4>
        The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now.
        <h4>PETRUCHIO</h4>
        I say it is the moon that shines so bright.
        <h4>KATHARINA</h4>
        I know it is the sun that shines so bright.
        <h4>PETRUCHIO</h4>
        Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself,<br>
        It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,<br>
        Or ere I journey to your father's house.<br>
        Go on, and fetch our horses back again.<br>
        Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!
        <h4>HORTENSIO</h4>
        Say as he says, or we shall never go.
        <h4>KATHARINA</h4>
        Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,<br>
        And be it moon, or sun, or what you please:<br>
        An if you please to call it a rush-candle,<br>
        Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.
        <h4>PETRUCHIO</h4>
        I say it is the moon.
