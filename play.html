        <h6>SCENE V. A public road.</h6>
        <p>Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, HORTENSIO, and Servants</p> 
        <h6>PETRUCHIO</h6>
        <p>Come on, i' God's name; once more toward our father's.
        Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!</p>
        <h6>KATHARINA</h6>
        <p>The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now.</p>
        <h6>PETRUCHIO</h6>
        <p>I say it is the moon that shines so bright.</p>
        <h6>KATHARINA</h6>
        <p>I know it is the sun that shines so bright.</p>
        <h6>PETRUCHIO</h6>
        <p>Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself,
        It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
        Or ere I journey to your father's house.
        Go on, and fetch our horses back again.
        Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!</p>
        <h6>HORTENSIO</h6>
        <p>Say as he says, or we shall never go.</p>
        <h6>KATHARINA</h6>
        <p>Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
        And be it moon, or sun, or what you please:
        An if you please to call it a rush-candle,
        Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.</p>
        <h6>PETRUCHIO</h6>
        <p>I say it is the moon.</p>
        <h6>KATHARINA</h6>
        <p>I know it is the moon.</p>
        <h6>PETRUCHIO</h6>
        <p>Nay, then you lie: it is the blessed sun.</p>
        <h6>KATHARINA</h6>
        <p>Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun:
        But sun it is not, when you say it is not;
        And the moon changes even as your mind.
        What you will have it named, even that it is;
        And so it shall be so for Katharina.</p>
        <h6>HORTENSIO</h6>
        Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won.
        PETRUCHIO
        Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,
        And not unluckily against the bias.
        But, soft! company is coming here.
        Enter VINCENTIO

        To VINCENTIO

        Good morrow, gentle mistress: where away?
        Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
        Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?
        Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
        What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,
        As those two eyes become that heavenly face?
        Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.
        Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.
        HORTENSIO
        A' will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.
        KATHARINA
        Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,
        Whither away, or where is thy abode?
        Happy the parents of so fair a child;
        Happier the man, whom favourable stars
        Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow!
        PETRUCHIO
        Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad:
        This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,
        And not a maiden, as thou say'st he is.
        KATHARINA
        Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,
        That have been so bedazzled with the sun
        That everything I look on seemeth green:
        Now I perceive thou art a reverend father;
        Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.
        PETRUCHIO
        Do, good old grandsire; and withal make known
        Which way thou travellest: if along with us,
        We shall be joyful of thy company.
        VINCENTIO
        Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
        That with your strange encounter much amazed me,
        My name is call'd Vincentio; my dwelling Pisa;
        And bound I am to Padua; there to visit
        A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
        PETRUCHIO
        What is his name?
